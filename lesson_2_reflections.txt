What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create an empty repository. This is create the hidden .git folder which will store any future commit metadata

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It acts as a buffer for the commit, and files here are not tracked. It allows you to select which files are updated in a commit, as for some files it may not be appropriate to update within the working directory, especially new or redundant ones.

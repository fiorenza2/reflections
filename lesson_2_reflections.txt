What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create an empty repository. This is create the hidden .git folder which will store any future commit metadata

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It acts as a buffer for the commit, and files here are not tracked. It allows you to select which files are updated in a commit, as for some files it may not be appropriate to update within the working directory, especially new or redundant ones.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows you to add/remove files such that you can ensure the above, which you can check quickly using 'git status'. You can also view the differences between WD/Stage/Master by using git diff to ensure one logical change.
